UDACITY - How to Use Git and GitHub - Lesson 3 Reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather then keeping all your
work local?
 - When you want to work from multiple computers or are collaborating with a
   team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather then having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - Because if it automatically update from the remote then you wouldn't know
   that changes are being made and it could over write or mess up changes you
   are testing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
 - A fork is a copy of another repository in GitHub (usually done because you
   don't have permission to edit their repository), a clone is a copy of a
   repository on your computer either from GitHub, another remote, or even from
   another local repository (used anytime you want to have another copy or the
   repository on your local box), and a branches is a path of commits that is
   separate from other paths of commits used to keep modifications separate
   (commonly between multiple developers).
