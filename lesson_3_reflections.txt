UDACITY - How to Use Git and GitHub - Lesson 3 Reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?
 - When you want to work from multiple computers or are colaborating with a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather then having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - Because if it automatically update from the remote then you wouldn't know
   that changes are being made and it could over write or mess up changes you
   are testing.
