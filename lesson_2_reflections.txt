UDACITY - How to Use Git and GitHub - Lesson 2 Reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?
 - Creating the repository creates the .git folder and structure to start
   tracking changes.  You need to do it so when you change a file there will
   be a record of the change.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
 - The staging area contains only the files that are to be included in the next
   commit; the working directory contains all files.  This is valuable because
   you can choose which files to commit to the repository.
